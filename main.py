#Make list of words

#player picks one randomly from the list

#based on the length of the word, make dashes

#player2 gueses one letter from the word,
# if the letter is in the word,

# 1 . insert the letter in its place in the word
#if the letter is not in the word, add an ascia to the hang robe

#enclose in a while loop so :
#1. hangs and ends if the handman is fully drawn
#2. end and player 2 wins if the word completes
